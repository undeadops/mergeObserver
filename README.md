# mergeObserver
Track time between branch creation and merge to master

## forword

This project is a starting point for monitoring the time delta between a branch creation and a merge to master.

There probably will be an additional work flow for a tag being applied to the master branch (because thats my actual usecase)

I'm also not found of this name, so it may be changed at some point.
